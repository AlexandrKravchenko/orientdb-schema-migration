This project contains bash scripts to apply schema migrations to an OrientDB
database. There are two key scripts. The script named
"odb-migrations-pre-2_2.sh" is designed to work with OrientDB versions prior to
2.2.x. The other script named "odb-migrations.sh" is designed to work with OrientDB
versions from 2.2.x onwards.
